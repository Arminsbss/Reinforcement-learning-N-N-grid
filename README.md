# Reinforcement-learning-N-N-grid
The game is simple! imagine a N-by-N grid which is filled with integers
where N represents the number of rows and columns. Each integer represents
the amount of reward you’ll get if you enter a specific cell. (of course negative
rewards are equivalent to punishments.) You’re job is to find the most-suiting
route in order to get from the bottom-left cell to the top-right one. However,
you may only move 1 cell upwards or rightwards at each step. The data
regarding the configuration of the grid is provided in the file ’Grid.xslx’.
You can load this file into your code and start digging around!
